## To start your local development server:

1. **Open Terminal** (on macOS, press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and press Enter)

2. **Navigate to your project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/awiros-tech/Downloads/rajat-creative-space-main
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## What should happen:

After running `npm run dev`, you should see output similar to this:
```
Vite dev server running at:
  Local:    http://localhost:8080/
  Network:  http://192.168.x.x:8080/
```

Then you can open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/` to see your application.

If you're still having issues, please share:
- What happens when you run the command
- Any error messages you see
- Whether the terminal shows the server starting successfully

Your project is properly configured and should work fine once the server starts!

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Method 1: Using Terminal (Recommended)

1. **Open Terminal** on your Mac:
   - Press `Cmd + Space` 
   - Type "Terminal"
   - Press Enter

2. **Navigate to your project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/awiros-tech/Downloads/rajat-creative-space-main
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Wait for the server to start** - you should see:
   ```
   Vite dev server running at:
     Local: http://localhost:8080/
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:8080/`

### Method 2: Using VS Code Terminal (if you have VS Code open)

1. In VS Code, go to **Terminal → New Terminal** (or press `` Ctrl + ` ``)
2. Make sure you're in the project directory (should show the project name)
3. Run: `npm run dev`

### Method 3: Using Cursor (if you're using Cursor IDE)

1. In Cursor, go to **Terminal → New Terminal**
2. Run: `npm run dev`

**After running the command**, please let me know:
- What output do you see in the terminal?
- Does it show "Vite dev server running at:"?
- Any error messages?

Once the server is running, your React application will be available at `http://localhost:8080/` and you can start developing!
